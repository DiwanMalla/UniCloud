- **Row Level Security** - Database-level access control
- **HTTPS** - Encrypted data transmission

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Project Settings > API to get your URL and anon key
4. Go to Storage and create a bucket named `user-files`
5. Go to SQL Editor and run the schema from `SETUP.md`

### 3. Set Up GitHub OAuth

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps
2. Create a new OAuth App:
   - Application name: `SecureUni`
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
GITHUB_ID=your-github-oauth-app-id
GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-oauth-app-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
```

### 5. Run the Application
